# ☕ CoffeeCo Internal Memo  
### Subject: IT Infrastructure Completion & Contract Conversion  
**Date:** [End of Chapter 1 Timeline]

**To:** Chris [Sysadmin / Consultant]  
**From:** Becky Brewster, CEO, CoffeeCo  
**CC:** Todd Brewster, CFO

**Chris,**

After the recent rollout of the *CoffeeCo Server Thing™*, both shops are now logging in with real accounts, sharing files without emailing each other ZIPs, and haven’t lost a single spreadsheet to “the void” in over two weeks.  
Todd even said the printer hasn’t “attacked the network” once since your new setup went live.

That’s basically a miracle.

We’ve decided to bring you on **full-time as our Systems Administrator.**  
You’ll oversee all IT operations going forward, including the exciting next step: setting up proper patch management and maybe—*gasp*—a ticket system that isn’t Post-It notes.

Your caffeine stipend remains unchanged. (Todd says it’s “above market rate” anyway.)

Welcome officially to CoffeeCo.

*“Because uptime tastes better with caffeine.”*
