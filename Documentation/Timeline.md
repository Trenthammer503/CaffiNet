## 🧭 Interpretation

- **Ch 1 & 2:** Occur within the same expansion era — roughly the first business year.  
  - Ch 1 → builds the foundation.  
  - Ch 2 → formalizes and scales processes.

- **Later chapters** represent ~1–2 years each, mirroring realistic company growth and your skill progression.

- **By Ch 4**, CaffiNet is in its “scale or die” period — moving to hybrid cloud and embracing new tech.  
  Each jump should feel earned both narratively and technically.
