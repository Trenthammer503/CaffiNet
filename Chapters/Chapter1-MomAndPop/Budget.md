## ‚úÖ Notes & Assumptions:
- Many licenses will be evaluation versions in the lab (i.e., cost to you = $0), but estimated real-world cost is shown for realism.  
- Used/refurbished hardware could bring CapEx down further (e.g., server for $400).  
- Future chapters will track incremental costs as CaffiNet expands/grows or moves to cloud.  
- The ‚ÄúCoffee fund‚Äù is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it adds flavor to your portfolio and shows you think like a business.

## üìä Future Tracking:
- As you progress to Chapter 2, 3, etc., you‚Äôll update this file or add new rows when new hardware/services are introduced.  
- Create a top-level aggregated cost document (`/Documentation/IT-Costs.md`) to compare chapters side by side.
