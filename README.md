# ☕ CoffeeCo Infrastructure Project

Welcome to **CoffeeCo** — a fictional (but realistic) small business that just realized their entire IT “infrastructure” is a single dusty Dell laptop sitting under the owner’s desk next to a Keurig. You’ve been hired to fix that.

This project is a **scenario-driven sysadmin & cloud engineering simulation**, designed to mimic a real career progression from **desktop support → systems admin → cloud engineer**. Every “chapter” represents a stage in CoffeeCo’s growth, each with its own business problems, infrastructure challenges, and technical goals.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To **design, build, and document** a full hybrid IT environment — from a small on-premises Windows Server setup to a scalable Azure-backed cloud environment — while treating each stage like a real-world consulting engagement.

This project combines:
- Hands-on technical learning (Windows Server, Proxmox, Azure, networking)
- Real-world simulation (tickets, business requests, growth scenarios)
- Portfolio documentation (diagrams, scripts, configs)
- Humor, caffeine, and occasional chaos

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this simulation, you’ll be able to:
- Architect small-to-medium business infrastructure from scratch  
- Deploy and manage Windows Server and Azure environments  
- Automate tasks with PowerShell and cloud-native tools  
- Demonstrate real, portfolio-worthy systems engineering projects  
- Speak confidently in interviews about end-to-end environment design

## 🚀 Current Chapter
**Chapter 1 — “The Mom & Pop Infrastructure”**  
You’ve been hired by CoffeeCo, a small but growing local café chain. They just opened their second shop and discovered that "emailing themselves spreadsheets" doesn’t count as data management.

Time to fix that.
